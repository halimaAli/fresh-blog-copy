# Fresh project

This code is a duplicate of a website I created for my paper titled 'Fresh: Das Next Gen Framework,' specifically designed to explore the features of Fresh.

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation <br>
You also have to use your own SupaBase account to make the authentification work: https://supabase.com.


Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.

Deployed version (using Deno deploy): https://fresh-demo-blog.deno.dev
